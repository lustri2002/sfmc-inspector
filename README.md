## Fork notice

This project is a fork of the original [`TokyoYugen/sfmc-inspector`](https://github.com/TokyoYugen/sfmc-inspector) project.

All credit for the original idea, foundation, and early implementation goes to the original author. This fork builds on that work with additional navigation, search, linting, and UI improvements for Salesforce Marketing Cloud developers.

## What it does

SFMC Inspector runs inside your browser while you're logged into Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It reads your existing session — no OAuth setup, no credentials to enter — and gives you superpowers the native UI doesn't have.

### Features (v1.1.2)

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Session Detection** | Automatically detects your SFMC session from any open SFMC tab |
| **Data Extension Explorer** | Browse all DEs with quick search |
| **DE → Automation Map** | For any DE, see which Query Activities write to it and their SQL |
| **DE → Journey Map** | See which Journeys reference a DE as entry source or activity |
| **Automation Monitor** | Browse automations with status, schedule, and inline SQL preview |
| **Query Activity Index** | Index Query Activities, hydrate SQL text, and correlate queries with automations |
| **SQL Search Workspace** | Open a dedicated full-page SQL Search tool for searching SQL, target DEs, Query Activity names, and automation usage |
| **SQL Linter** | 10-rule static analysis for SFMC Query Activity SQL |
| **AMPScript Linter** | 10-rule static analysis for AMPScript V1 blocks |
| **Global Search** | ⌘K search across DEs, Automations, Journeys simultaneously |
| **View in SFMC** | Click native object names in Inspector to jump back into Salesforce Marketing Cloud |
| **Native DE Navigation** | Attempts to open Data Extensions inside the authenticated Contact Builder iframe using the DE ObjectID |
| **Native Automation Navigation** | Opens Automation Studio on the selected automation when a direct shell route is available |
| **Native Query Navigation** | Opens Query Activity modals from automation details and SQL search results |
| **Native Journey Navigation** | Opens Journey Builder on the selected Journey when journey IDs are available, otherwise falls back to Journey Builder |
| **Refreshed Popup UI** | Updated light Salesforce-inspired layout, detail panels, toolbar controls, loading states, and native-open affordances |

### Native navigation notes

SFMC apps are often rendered inside nested iframes, so not every object has a stable URL visible in the browser address bar. Inspector handles this in two ways:

- Automations, Query Activities, and Journeys use Marketing Cloud shell routes when a stable route is available.
- Data Extensions use a Contact Builder-specific flow: Inspector focuses the existing SFMC tab, opens Contact Builder, injects into available frames, detects the authenticated `contactsmeta` iframe, and navigates that iframe to the selected Data Extension properties route.

If a direct object route cannot be built, Inspector opens the closest native SFMC section instead of sending you to a broken login page.

## How authentication works

SFMC Inspector uses the **same session your browser already has** when you're logged into SFMC. It executes authenticated API calls directly inside your active SFMC tab using Chrome's scripting API — the browser's existing session is used 
automatically, without reading or storing cookies.

- ✅ No OAuth setup required
- ✅ No credentials stored
- ✅ No data sent to third parties
- ✅ Respects your SFMC permissions — you can only see what your user can access
- ✅ Detects session expiry and prompts you to refresh

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Before starting work on a feature, open an issue to discuss the approach.

**Code standards:**
- Vanilla JS only (no frameworks in content/background scripts)
- No `let`/`const`/arrow functions in content scripts (keep IE11-era compat for SFMC's older iframe contexts)
- All SFMC API calls go through `sfmc-api.js`
